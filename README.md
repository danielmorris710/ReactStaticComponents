# React Static Components
## About this Build
You are half way through the course! You've been showing off your portfolio and projects to your friends, family and classmates and they all say "It's fine. I like it!" But you want more insight.

<br>

So you decide to look into some analytical tools...but wow! They are expensive! You decide to make your own.

<br>

You visualize a dashboard with components for reviews, average rating, sentiment analysis and website visitors

<br>

Try to recreate this wireframe with React. Be sure to create a few components (e.g. app, sidebar, reviews, average rating, sentiment analysis, website visitors).

<br>

## Get Started
### Set up
- cd to todays /homework folder
- mkdir dashboard
- cd dashboard
- touch app.js index.html

<br>
index.html

- add html boilerplate
- add script tags
- add a main tag inside the body

```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.3.2/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.3.2/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.26.0/babel.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/babel" src="app.js"></script>
```

app.js
- render an h1 tag using react to test it:
```
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Commence Dashboard Creation!</h1>,
  document.querySelector('main')
);
```
Run a simple server:
 

Using npm :

- Install, if you haven't already, with npm install -g http-server (might need to run sudo npm install -g http-server)
- run http-server -o

<br>

Important Note:

To see updates you must refresh your browser, all three of the servers above do cache things, so you may have to do a hard refresh (hold shift key when doing a refresh) to see your changes. Remember `command shift r` as the hot keys
